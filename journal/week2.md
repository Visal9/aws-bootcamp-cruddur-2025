TODO: additional videos for addition assignments

* Instrument Honeycomb for the frontend-application to observe network latency between frontend and backend[HARD]

* Add custom instrumentation to Honeycomb to add more attributes eg. UserId, Add a custom span

Think sth important for instrumentation

* Run custom queries in Honeycomb and save them later eg. Latency by UserID, Recent Traces

Save query by userid or recent tracers

## Week 2 notes

Question for Jessica actually regarding honeycomb and today's class:

With the approach we used in docker compose of setting different service names for frontend and backend(which as far as I understand directs data to  different datasets within honeycomb)will we be able to produce a single trace containing combined latency between them? Can I combine results between datasets or will we have to tweak the approach?
